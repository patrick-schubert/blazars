# Deep Learning Blazar Classification based on Multi-frequency Spectral Energy Distribution Data
Project from September - 2019 to December - 2019 

Repository containing code for the paper: [Deep Learning Blazar Classification based on Multi-frequency Spectral Energy Distribution Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15340).

### Samples
Multi-frequency Spectral Energy Distribution Data samples. Feature space are sparse and highly redshifted.

Can you find a pattern that potentially classify any of the two classes?
