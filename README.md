# Deep Learning Blazar Classification based on Multi-frequency Spectral Energy Distribution Data
Project from September - 2019 to December - 2019 

Repository containing code for the paper: [Deep Learning Blazar Classification based on Multi-frequency Spectral Energy Distribution Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15340).

### Samples
Multi-frequency Spectral Energy Distribution Data samples. Feature space are sparse and highly redshifted.

Can you find a pattern that potentially classify any of the two classes?

### ROC Statistics

### Map of Attention
Statistics designed within the old keras framework to provide explainability of what features are important for the model to make an inference. This procedure enables investigation of physics motivation behind the learned decision boundary from the model.
